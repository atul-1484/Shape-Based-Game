<p>Java concepts such as class, Object, Constructor, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Upcasting, Method Overriding, HAS-A Relationship, Interface</p>
<h3>Description:</h3>
I designed and implemented an engaging educational game tailored for students in classes 6 to 12th, aimed at enhancing their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes.<br>
The game features a user interface where students can interact with various shapes by clicking on them.<br>
It uses object-oriented programming principles, I incorporated key concepts such as has-a-relationship, method overriding, method overloading, constructor overriding, inheritance, and upcasting to create a robust and extensible codebase.
